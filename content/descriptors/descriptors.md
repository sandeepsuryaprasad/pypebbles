## Python Descriptors — Building a Reusable JSON Field Mapping Framework
**Last Updated:** August 15, 2026

When working with real-world APIs, JSON responses are often far more complex than 
simple key-value structures. A single response can contain deeply nested objects, 
collections, optional fields, and multiple levels of related data. Accessing such 
data directly through dictionary lookups can quickly become verbose, difficult to read,
and tightly coupled to the structure of the response. 

In one of the projects I worked on in the airline domain, we had to work with complex
JSON responses containing information about reservations, passengers, flights, 
airports, aircraft, baggage, and several other related entities. As the response 
structure became more complex, accessing and working with the data through conventional 
dictionary lookups became increasingly difficult to read and maintain.

This article presents a real-world scenario inspired by that project and demonstrates how I approached the problem using Python's object-oriented capabilities.
The solution uses Python descriptors to map fields from the JSON response to Python attributes and to transparently construct objects for nested structures.

The implementation presented in this article is a simplified and generalised version of the approach used in the project, with domain-specific details modified for demonstration purposes.
